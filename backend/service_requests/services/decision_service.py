Unified Customer Decision Engine.
Processes customer decisions (ACCEPT / DECLINE) originating from either:
1. Self-service Customer Portal (tokenized web page)
2. Customer Support Phone CSRs (phone-recorded with mandatory CSR notes)

Both channels trigger the EXACT same underlying business state transitions.
